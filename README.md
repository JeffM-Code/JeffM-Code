## Hi there üëã<br><br>
Data analyst with interests in:<br>
* Machine learning<br>
* Data science<br>
* Sustainable energy development<br>

## ‚ö° Projects:<br><br>
Normally around energy and physics as that's my background. My goal is to apply ML to each field, as I find great interest and value from putting data to work.<br><br>
* [Projects](https://github.com/JeffM-Code/PortfolioWork)<br><br>

## ‚ú® Goals:<br><br>
* Apply ML to data to uncover intrinsic insights or value<br>
* Develop useful models / insights in sustainable energy development<br><br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Progress:<br><br>
* Ground work for model / project ideas set, potential to explore current projects in depth or inspire others<br>
* ML / data science foundations establish to build on and incorporate cloud computing and pretrained models for impact<br><br><br>

I do hope my work is interesting, as I normally only like to publish something worth reading.
